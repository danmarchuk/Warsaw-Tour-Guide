# WarsawTourGuide


Project Overview
This project was a chance for me to combine and practice everything I learned in one of the sections of the Nanodegree program on Udacity.com. I have made my own multi-screen Android app to share your knowledge about a city I am very familiar with.

The goal was to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting my city. The app can list top malls, shops, galleries and museums of the city. It contains all the best known secrets that only locals know. 

This project was about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

  - Planning your app design and navigation before coding
  - Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
  - Building layouts to display those lists of data
  - Navigating between lists in Fragments using a ViewPager plus TabLayout
  - Creating your own custom classes
  - Properly handling images
